"Analyzing Crime Trends (2020-2025) Using Python & Data Science ðŸ“Š"
Hi connections! ðŸ‘‹ Dr.Dhiraj Kapila
 Iâ€™m excited to share a recent project I completed as part of my coursework in Computer Applications.
I developed a Python project to analyze crime data from 2020 to 2025 using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. 
The project involved data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and creating visualizations (such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots) that reveal trends 
and anomalies in crime patterns. This work highlights the practical power of data-driven insights for understanding and addressing complex societal challenges.
